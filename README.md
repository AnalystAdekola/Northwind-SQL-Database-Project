# Northwind-SQL-Project
Purpose: In business, things change, and data in an organizationâ€™s database must be modified to reflect those changes. In this project, I will insert new data into the Northwind database and then update a table in the database. I will also develop SQL DML statements to retrieve data addressing several business inquiries. I will use the Northwind database for this project.
